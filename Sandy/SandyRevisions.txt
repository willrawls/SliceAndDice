Version		Date Released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.8.159		8/14/2000

	1. New Inline SoftCommand:

		%%ChooseDir%%
			Returns a full path that the user browses to.
			Offers to cancel insertion if no path is selected.
	

	
1.8.156		8/13/2000

	1. Added these awesome new SoftCommands:

	   SliceAndDice.dll

		~~GotoKeyboard
			Sends output to the keyboard ala SendKeys() vs. the
			VB IDE or nowhere if run from the System tray. This
			makes doing multiple ~~SendKeys unnecessary and
			bring Sandy's clipboard/keyboard handling abilities
			into the light of day.

		~~GotoClipboard
			Sends output to the clipboard's text data vs. the
			VB IDE or nowhere if run from the System tray.
	   
		~~GotoMessage
			Sends output as if ~~ShowMessage had been called.


	   sadSoftCoreWmr.dll

		~~ShowMessage
			Show a read-only multiline message box.

		~~EditMessage X=Y
			Pauses insertion to allow a static string or the
			contents of a soft variable to be edited.


	2. Added items to the "Externals" pull-down menu

	   sadSoftCoreWmr.dll

		Revision History
			Does a ~~ShowMessage of the new SandyRevisions.txt
			file (this file).


	3. Attempting to clean up the built-in template editor to be nicer:
	   a. CTRL-I doesn't deposit a CTRL-I after insertion if you're
		inside a template when you hit CTRL-I (which you'd have to be).


	4. New Global hot keys (available from any Windows app, even games):

	   CTRL + SHIFT +
		S		Opens main Sandy window
		E		Pops up the Externals pulldown menu
		F		Pops up the Favorites pulldown menu
		R		Repeats the last template insertion
		1 through 0	Activates the associated template
				If no template associated, it asks
				which one, defaulting to the current.
				Currently, no way to unassociate (ask) once done.
	   
	   CTRL+SHIFT+1 to 0 can be deactivated from the Options pulldown menu

	   Currently the others cannot be deactivated and are always associated
	      with the FIRST loaded instance of Sandy. So if 2 are loaded, only
	      the FIRST will get the keys.


	5. Fixed the OLE-editing features of the main window.

	6.

1.8.155		8/12/2000

	1. Started keeping this version history... 
	   Yeah, I should have done it long ago, well I'm doing it now.

	2. Fixed the bug that prevented Sandy from detecting the type of VB 
	   procedure the user requested in such SoftCommands as 
	   "~~GotoProc NewEnum Get 0". Still not sure when that one creeped in, 
	   but it's probably been in there for a few months at least.
	
	3. Sent new DLLs to programmer reporting the problem who is also working
	   on "sadSpSql", the first 3rd party Sandal that will allow for limited,
	   but extremely useful integration and inline SoftCode stored procedure
	   information/schema "lifting" which is very thrilling since I've only 
	   been waiting 2 1/2 years for someone to do one without me writing it 
	   for them.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.8.115 through 1.8.155

	1. William Rawls takes a much needed vacation, loses his mind, finds it 
	   again, realizes not working WON'T pay the bills, spends several months
	   doing stupid stuff, eventually begs a job doing non-VB stuff... Turns
	   out to be the best thing since it forced him to allow Sandy to run
	   both inside and outside VB and further allowed him to use it for other
	   text processing including XML, HTML, ColdFusion, and even Diablo 2
	   chat string pasting with 100% success.

	2. William remembers why he beleived in Sandy but vows to keep it free
	   and to stop "preaching" the gospel of Sandy... Still winds up doing
	   it anyway.

	3. William starts accepting donations (hint hint hint) at 
	   http://www.sliceanddice.com in the hopes that some wise, rich 
	   programmer will give William tons of cash to quit his job and work at
	   home on Slice and Dice full-time thus bringing not only the current
	   version, but 100's of new features, SoftCommands, templates, and
	   whole new vistas of usage for Slice and Dice in
	   and beyond programming.

	4. William returns to Earth and decides to start keeping a revision
	   history... (big smile)

	5. Finally broke down and gave Sandy a life free from VB or in VB.
	   "SandyShell" is born. Started writing a second template library
	   that features 100% non-VB templates that manipulate the clipboard
	   ( "SandyClipboard" ). Have a lot of clean up work to do
